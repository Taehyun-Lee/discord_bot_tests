# discord_bot_tests

A repository to do some tests with python discord API (just play around a bit👍👍).

## Goal
Make a bunch of .py files that contain simple tests that will run the bot.
All the necessary code to run the bot will be in each .py file, so that there isn't a need to look around.

## Tests
Just in case anyone wants to see some simple discord API calls, I'll keep it organized.
